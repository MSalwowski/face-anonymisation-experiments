# Description

This project was carried out as part of the Biometric Systems course at DTU in June 2023.

# Goal

The goal of this project is to experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of existing methods for anonymizing facial images. By conducting experiments and creating a database of anonymized faces, we aim to assess the level of privacy protection achieved by different techniques while maintaining visual coherence. Additionally, we will evaluate the impact of anonymization on biometric performance to understand how these techniques affect the accuracy and reliability of facial recognition systems.
